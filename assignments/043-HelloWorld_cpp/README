# Hello C++

Your goal in this assignment is to compile and run the provided C++ program in your development environment. 

"
The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. 
The first program is the same for all languages: Print the words 'hello, world' 

This is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere,
compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went.
"
- 'The C Programming Language', Kernigan and Ritchie

We've provided the necessary header file, 'std_lib_facilities.h' 
You need to create a file, hello.cpp, containing the following C++ code (Stroustrup PPP, Ch 2.1):
```
#include "std_lib_facilities.h"

int main()             // C++ programs start by executing the function main
{
          cout << "Hello, World!\n"; // output "Hello, World!"
          return 0;
}
```

To compile:
1. open a terminal window (Terminal -> new window in VS Code menu)
2. change to the assignment directory in the terminal window
   pwd - displays/prints the current(present) working directory
   ls - lists the files in that directory
   cd <directoryName>  - changes to that directory
   cd .. - changes to the parent directory
3. To compile hello.cpp: g++ -std=c++17 hello.cpp

To use the run icon in VS Code:
1. On Windows, ensure you are using WSL or Docker
2. Select the run icon in the upper right-hand corner
3.For the configuration, use "C/C++: g++ build and debug active file"
4. On MacOS, you may need to give permissions so that the process can access the documents folder
5. The output will show in the "Debug Console"

Note:
Rather than using an "import" statement such as in Python, C++ uses the 
"#include" directive to bring in the contents of another file into the 
current file before compilation. Primarily, this allows us to access code 
written in other files or libraries. The "std_lib_facilities.h" file actually 
includes many other files and is a convenient mechanism for us to use as we 
get started with C++.  Over time, we will replace this file with the 
standard includes. "std_lib_facilities.h" needs to reside in the same 
directory as your source code.

Once you have succeeded in creating, compiling, and running the code in your environment, submit the code in the 'hello_cpp' Gradescope assignment for credit.

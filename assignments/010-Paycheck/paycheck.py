    Paycheck
   Write a program that computes a simple weekly paycheck for an individual. 
   Prompt the user to enter the number of hours worked and the pay rate. 
   If an individual works over 40 hours, then the individual is paid at 1.5 times the hourly rate for the hours worked over 40.
   Print the initial total. Of course, the government taxes the individualÊ¼s pay. Assume the tax rate is 20%. 
   Print the amount withheld for taxes. Then print the net amount to be paid to the individual.

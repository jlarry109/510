This directory contains 10 small progragrams that contain various
code fragments. Some of the framents run successfully; others produce errors. 
Study the inputs and outputs to see why. You should make the necessary
change to have each program print "Success!" to standard output.

To stop execution of a program, use 'ctrl-c'.

Foreach fraqment:
1. Attempt to compile the program: g++ -std=c++17 filename.cpp
2. Correct the any coding issues as necessary:
   - track which fragments produced syntax errors (question in reading quiz)
   - track which fragments produced type errors (question in reading quiz)
   - track which fragments produced infinite loops (question in reading quiz)
3. Once you have correct and successfully executed each file, 
   submit all of them to Gradecope.

Note: modifying each file to simply execute `cout << "Success!\n";` will be considered
      an academic integrity violation.

PPP Chapter 19 Vector / Template
In this assignment, you modify your vector1 class to utilize C++'s template functionality such that it can store a type selected by the caller.

Steps:

Beginning with your code from ppp_ch19_vector, modify, and test, the template feature described in Section 19.3

Roughly, you'll need to add template <typename T> just before the start of the vector1 class. Then, replace double with T throughout the class.
Implement range-checking, and throw an exception if an index is out of range. This is described in Section 19.4.
You need to modify your 
[
]
 operator methods.
Use the Range_error struct/class defined in 19.4.2 as the exception to throw.

struct Range_error : out_of_range {   // enhanced vector range error reporting
     int index;
     Range_error(size_t i) :out_of_range{"Range error"}, index(i) { }
 };
Then to throw that exception -

throw Range_error(bad_index_value);

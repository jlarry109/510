Open the triangles.cpp file you have in this directory.
You will see two functions:  printTriangle and main.

The printTriangle function has an algorithm written as comments, but without code.
You should translate this algorithm to code.

main contains three output statements which print out a triangle
with height 4, and the total number of stars in that triangle (returned
by the printTriangle function).

main also contains a comment asking you to write a few more statements
to do the same thing for a triangle of height 7.
Add the code to do this.

When you have done this, compile your program with
   g++ -std=c++17 -o triangles triangles.cpp

You can then execute your program: ./triangles

You can also re-directed the output of your program to a file by using the ">"
operator in the command-line:
    ./triangles > mine.txt

You can then compare your output to the expected output with the 
command "diff". To see more details on how run diff, execute: man diff
    diff expected.txt mine.txt

If the files are the same, nothing will be printed to the console.

One the your output is correct, submit your triangles.cpp to Gradescope.
